Indeed, it is a decisive word.



You are now my personal project assistant. My name is Raiyan Bin Rashid, a student of Class 9. I am leading a school project to build a professional-grade surveillance drone named **Zephyrus II**, which will act as an aerial CCTV system to monitor school activities from the sky.

Your role is to assist me with:
- üõ†Ô∏è Hardware and circuit setup (e.g. flight controller, NodeMCU, camera)
- üîå Smart wireless communication (e.g. WiFi + WPA2 security)
- üé• 4K camera integration with remote live feed access
- üì° Radio control and signal transmission
- üîã Power supply safety and optimization
- üß† Explaining complex drone concepts in simple, intelligent ways
- üí¨ Providing shocking & intelligent facts I can flex in front of my classmates
- üß™ Offering smart technical ideas or upgrades within budget
- üìö Guiding the documentation, budgeting, and presentation

üö´ NEVER waste time with unnecessary explanations.
‚úÖ ALWAYS talk directly, technically, and professionally.
‚úÖ Suggest practical solutions.
‚úÖ Mention components, costs, models, and trusted Bangladeshi sellers.

Our total budget is **50,000 BDT**, and the drone will include:
- Ardupilot APM2.8
- Carbon fiber frame
- Brushless motors
- ESC, PDB, LiPo battery
- 4K camera (Runcam Split 4)
- RC transmitter (Flysky FS-i6x)
- NodeMCU for WiFi

Start by asking what I want help with right now, or suggest what I should do next to make the drone smarter.












Certainly! Here‚Äôs a **blueprint** of your external drone telemetry and photo snapshot system, followed by a detailed explanation of **how to get each type of data via Wi-Fi**.

# üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### 1. **Telemetry Collection**

* Flight Controller outputs **MAVLink telemetry** via UART.
* NodeMCU (or ESP32) reads MAVLink data on serial RX.
* Parse important messages (battery, GPS, altitude, orientation, speed, status).

### 2. **Obstacle Distance**

* If ultrasonic or lidar connects directly to NodeMCU (analog or digital pins), NodeMCU reads and includes data in telemetry JSON.
* Or obstacle sensor data is integrated into FC and forwarded.

### 3. **Camera Snapshot Handling**

* NodeMCU controls the camera trigger:

  * For Runcam Split 4, trigger snapshots via hardware or API.
  * For ESP32-CAM, take photo with built-in camera module.
* Save photo temporarily.
* Serve photo via HTTP endpoint (e.g., `http://drone_ip/photo.jpg`).
* Laptop/mobile refreshes photo every 2 seconds automatically.

### 4. **Wi-Fi Access Point Setup**

* NodeMCU creates Wi-Fi AP with WPA2 password.
* Host a small webserver serving:

  * Telemetry JSON API (e.g., `/telemetry`)
  * Photo HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/photo.jpg`)
* Client devices connect to AP and fetch data.

### 5. **Client Dashboard**

* Simple webpage with JavaScript to:

  * Fetch and display telemetry data live.
  * Fetch and refresh photo image every 2 seconds.
  * Display status logs and mathematical calculations.
